challenge #1
### Minus Plus

Given an array of integers, calculate the fractions of its elements that are positive, negative, and are zeros. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line.

I resolved this problem with: C, C#, JS and TS.

just to practice and improve a little bit each day.

##### Running

To run on C you will need C compiler (gcc) installed, the run:
```gcc ./src/main.c -o ./build/test; ./build/test```
