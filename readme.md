challenge #1

### Minus Plus

Given an array of integers, calculate the fractions of its elements that are positive, negative, and are zeros. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line.

I resolved this problem with: C, C#, JS and TS.

just to practice and improve a little bit each day.

##### Running:

To run the C# program you will need the dotnet sdk installed, then go to the folder ./src/csharp and run:

`dotnet run`

To run the C program you will need the C compiler (gcc) installed, then run:

`gcc ./src/main.c -o ./build/test; ./build/test`

To run the JavaScript program you will need the NodeJS installed, then run:

`node ./src`

To run the TypeScript program you will need the TS-Node/NPM and the typescript module, then run:

`ts-node ./src/index.ts`
